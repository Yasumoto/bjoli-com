  <h1>Axes of Testing</h1>
    <p>I've tried many different tacks when explaining the benefits of unit testing to developers. Contrary to what I used to preach, they are just another tool that can be used, and certainly have their limitations. What follows is the best breakdown I've come up with to describe the various types of tests and when to lean on them. It was presented at a Twitter-internal Python tech talk, and many teammates nudged me to publish it externally. I hope it will allow others to understand how to approach adding different types of tests for your codebase.</p>
