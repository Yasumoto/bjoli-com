I'm a software engineer on the Operations Team at <a href="https://slack.com">Slack.
I love working on tough distributed systems problems, and learning from my team and the
community!

Previously, I was the <a href="http://mesos.apache.org">Mesos</a>/<a href="http://aurora.apache.org">Aurora</a>
SRE Tech Lead at Twitter, and an Internal Technology Resident at Google. I received a Computer
Science BS in May 2010 from Chapman University in Orange, California.
