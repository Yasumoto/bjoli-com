<h2>Bay Area Pathfinder Society</h2>
<p>I'm a <a href="http://paizo.com/people/Yasumoto">Venture Lieutenant for San Francisco</a>,
   which means I help organize events and conventions, in addition to
   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BayAreaPathfinderSociety">running our Facebook page</a>.
   If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, there are a lot of great games hosted by the
   <a href="https://bayareapathfinder.com">Bay Area Pathfinder Society</a>! In particular,
   <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/endgame">Endgame in Oakland</a> hosts events on Monday
   evenings, and <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/gamescape-sf-pfs">Gamescape in San Francisco</a>
   hosts a Saturday game day each month.</p>

   which contains a massive Raccoon-like creature I designed called a <i>Procyon</i>! It was a great
   experience to work with that group, and it's available
